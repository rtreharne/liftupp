# LiftUpp Data Python Scripts

Here are a bunch of scripts that manipulate the raw data downloadble from the LiftUpp portal.

## format.py

Usage: run the following command in a parent dicrectory to downloaded .csv files:

```console
$ python3 format.py "<data_folder>"
```

This will output an gc_upload_xxx.xlsx file into the current directory.
