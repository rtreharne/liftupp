You can always go back to it when you need to repeat this experiments especially when you can't reproduce the experiments carried out before. 

Also, the use of your blue book now prepares you for second semester where you use only your lab book throughout the practicals. 

It helps you retain forgotten information about your experiments for writing abstracts and report
